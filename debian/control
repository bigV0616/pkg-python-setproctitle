Package: python-setproctitle
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, ${python:Depends}
Description: setproctitle implementation for Python
 The library allows a process to change its title (as displayed by system tools
 such as ps and top).
 .
 Changing the title is mostly useful in multi-process systems, for example when
 a master process is forked: changing the children's title allows one to
 identify the task each process is busy with. The technique is used by
 PostgreSQL and the OpenSSH Server for example.
